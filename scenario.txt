## Control host

# Start Openbsd instance (ami-17110571)
# Connect
ssh ec2-user@

# How did my key get there?
https://github.com/ajacoutot/aws-openbsd/blob/master/ec2-init.sh
cat /usr/local/libexec/ec2-init

# When is it executed?
By netstart (before most daemons)
cat /etc/hostname.xnf0

# What does it do?

Script relies on AWS metadatas:
ftp -MVo - http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data

- Run only at first boot (check instance id: file vs metadata )
- Create first boot file (/var/db/ec2-init) with instance id
- Get key from metadata
- Set hostname from metadata
- Execute user-data script 
- Create rc.firsttime script to log ssh keys at next boot 
- Clean up instance (remove old ssh keys, dhcp leases and conf, old logs)


# What permissions do I have?
does cat /etc/doas.conf


# terraform
